progress: 

- added the main.py that calls gemini api; output.md stores most recent response.
- added utils.py with a function to count api calls by files; just call this function after each statement that invokes api call.
- added monica_api_caller.py to deal with monica but need to write proper functions or at least find a way to parse parameters properly.
